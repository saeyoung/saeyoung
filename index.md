# Hello

I am a Master’s student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), studying Technology Policy and Computer Science. I am currently working at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) and supervised by Professor [Devavrat Shah](https://devavrat.mit.edu/).

I develop statistical tools to facilitate causal inference. One of the nice datasets to play with is sports datasets. Using cricket and basketball data, I develop and refine methods to predict score trajectory of a game. This method can be applied to a situation where an intervention was made, to predict the counterfactual outcome. For example, I apply the method in policy analysis to see the effect of an implemented policy.

If you want to discuss potential collaborative opportunities, I can be reached at srho (at) mit (dot) edu.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/saeyoung/saeyoung/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
