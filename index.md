# Hello

I am a Master’s student in the Technology and Policy Program (TPP) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science. I am currently working at CSAIL and supervised by Professor Devavrat Shah.

I am developing skills in data science and applied statistics. I study how to analyze big data using machine learning and stochastic methodologies to perform desired analysis and modeling. In addition to that, as an interdisciplinary graduate student in TPP, I try to apply the developed method to a real-world situation.

If you want to discuss potential collaborative opportunities, I can be reached at srho (at) mit (dot) edu.
